# Atlasan | Changing Dimensionality of Maps for Indoor Navigation

2022-2023 Senior Research Lab Project

## Features In Progress

Fix bugs :D

**Processing**
* Create unique identifier for each name for navigation
* Remove incorrect room names by looking at near-by room names and see if it is likely to be located there

**Navigation**
* Multi-floor pathfinding
    * Sync up floors to match based on stairs
* Replace hard-coded values

**User-Interface**
* Render staircases & elevators
* Add indoor-lighting
* Update upload / capture page layout & CSS

## Future Ideas
* Add automatic stairway detection (ones represented by striped lines)
* Find multiple possible paths
* Detect room names that are vertically-oriented
* Improve accuracy
